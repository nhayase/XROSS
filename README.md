# HYS
HYS is the python-based simulator for nanoscale mulatilayer. This is completely free and open source. 

Please cite "HYS, arXiv (2024), (https://github.com/nhayase/HYS/)" when you use!!

## Algorithm
Be sure that

## User interface
Easy use

## Programming
Merits of the HYS is preferred physics formulation can be introduced by your hand wiout any tedious preparation.
We should write down your physics model as follow.

(1) Write "import hys" at first.

(2) 

(3) Put your written files into the folder.
