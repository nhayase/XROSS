# HYS
HYS is the Python-based nanoscale multilayer simulator that is completely free and open source. 

Please cite "HYS, arXiv (2024), (https://github.com/nhayase/HYS/)" when you use!!

## Algorithm
Be sure that

## User interface
You can design mulltilayer structures.

Further operation is written in PDF manual.

## Programming
The merit of the HYS is preferred physics formula with some parametres can be introduced by your hand without any tedious preparation.
You should write down your physics model as follow.

(1) Write "import hys" in your Python file (such as Spyder).

(2) def_parametre & def_formula

(3) Put your written files into the folder.
