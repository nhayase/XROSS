## Usage

### 1. Modelling 
→ Modelling a structure by "Layer" (a single layer) & "Subroutine" (a multilayer) on the main window.

→ Right-click on "Subroutine", you can setup a number of pairs (& its name) as a multilayer.

→ Click the toggles (it changes blue color) on the left side of "Layer", you can modify an arrangement of them & click "Up" or "Down".
